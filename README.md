The Stabilization Code was written for the Scientific Programming Class at UWRF.
The Rotate code was written by Begad and Roman for their Analog Electronics course at UWRF.

The active roll control code takes both functions and combines them for the flight where we will need both.

The stabilization code will be used independently for the preliminary flight where the goal is to minimize roll.
