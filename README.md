UWRF Rocket Team 2018

The Stabilization Code was written for the Scientific Programming Class at UWRF.
The Rotate code was written by Begad and Roman for their Analog Electronics course at UWRF.

The Active Roll Control with Stabilization code takes both functions and combines them for the flight where we will need both.

The Independent Stabilization code will be used independently(how ironic) for the preliminary flight where the goal is to minimize roll and hold the same position that the rocket was in on the launch pad.

Both of the main stabilization functions are used in both flight codes but the arguments have been changed to adapt to the flight parameters. (ex. the stabilization flight does not need a hold time as an input because the position is supposed to be held throughout the entire flight)

Additionally the conditional statements(for, if, do, while, etc.) may have also been changed to effectively execute the desired flight pattern.
